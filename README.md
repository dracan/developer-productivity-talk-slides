# Developer Productivity Talk Slides

This is the source code for the slides from my Developer Productivity talk that I did at the [DDD Southwest](https://dddsouthwest.com/) conference.

They have been built using [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/), and the `index.html` is the main file with the slide details.

I've published these to Azure which can [be found here](http://developer-productivity-talk-dddsw-2018.azurewebsites.net/#/31).
