# Developer Productivity Talk Slides

This is the source code for the slides from my Developer Productivity talk that I did at the [DDD Southwest](https://dddsouthwest.com/) conference.

They have been built using [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/), and the `index.html` is the main file with the slide details.

I've published these to Azure which can [be found here](http://developer-productivity-talk-dddsw-2018.azurewebsites.net/#/31).

## Instructions to run locally

* Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* Run `npm install` from the command line (one needed once)
* Run `npm start` from the command line (this will open slides in browser)

## Useful keyboard shortcuts

* **?**: Show all keyboard shortcuts
* **f**: Fullscreen
